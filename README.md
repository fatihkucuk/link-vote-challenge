# Link Vote Challenge

This is a link vote application. You can add/delete links. In addition you can up vote and down vote the link points.
Also there is a sorting option which sorts the link as most voted or less voted.

In this project I used React with hooks, React-Router, Redux and Redux-Saga for state management and React-Bootstrap as UI Library.

All the datas are coming from the localStorage and also saving there.
